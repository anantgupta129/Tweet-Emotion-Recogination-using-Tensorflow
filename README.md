# Tweet-Emotion-Recogination-using-Tensorflow

**Emotion Dataset**

This is a dataset that can be used for emoton classification. It has already been preprocessed based on the approach described in
[paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1404/). It is also stored as a pandas dataframe and ready to be used in an NLP pipeline.
The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain, using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.

This dataset is great for starting NLP
